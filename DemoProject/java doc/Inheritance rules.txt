Type of Inheritance :
---------------------
1) single
2) Multi-level
3) Hirarichal 
4) Multiple - Not supported in java
5) Hybrid

How many way that inheretance can be formed:
---------------------------------------------
1) is-a relationship
2) Has-a relationship

Advantage of inheretance :
--------------------------
code re-usability by reducing code complexity


Inheritance Principles:
-----------------------
1. is-a relationship/ Has-a relationship
2. extends keyword / creating Parent class Object in child class
3. code reuse & reduse code complexity
4. subclass and superclass 
5. inheritance with access modifiers (public,<default>)
6. No multiple inheritance accepted
7. Type casting-upcasting and downcasting 
8. Overriding methods 
9. Calling superclass methods 
10. instanceof instruction 
11. Fields and inheritance 
12. Constructors and inheritance 
13. Nested classes and inheritance 
14. Abstract classes and inheritance


Properties of inheritance:
--------------------------
i> All the variables/methods of parent class are by default available to child    class.
   Hence on child class reference variables we can call both parent class    variables/methods and child class variables/methods.

ii> None of the variables/methods of child class are available to the parent class     hence on parent class reference variable we can call only parent class     variables/methods but we cannot call child class variables/methods.

iii> We can use parent class reference variable to refer/hold child class object.

iv> We cannot use child class reference variable to hold parent class object.
