Polymorphism:
-------------
Polymorphism is the ability of an object or a method to take multiple forms.

a>About an object
   i>parent class reference variable can refer/hold child class objects.
   ii>interface reference variable can refer implementation class object.
   
   Ex:
   ---
   Parent p1=new Child1();
       p1=new Child2();
       P1=new Child3();

b) about an method
overloading is static polymorphism and overriding is dynamic polymorphism.

Static polymorphism: 
--------------------
It is the process in which a call to an overloaded method is resolved at compile time not at runtime.
In this process an overloaded method is called using the reference variable of a class and the same class method is executed.
Test t=new Test();
t.m1(10);
t.m1(tr);

Dynamic polymorphism: 
---------------------
It is the process in which a call to an overridden method(it means it is parent method) is resolved at runtime not at compile time.
In this process an overridden method is called using parent reference variable but execution of the method is determined by the runtime object.

Parent p1=new Child();
p1.m1();//m1() method is overridden method of parent class.

In the above m1() method of parent class is called.But m1() method of child class is executed.
